totaling over $1.4 billion Monday, as issuers raced to clear their books by the end of the year.
The $646.5 million UBS 2018-C15 is backed by 41 loans secured by 317 properties,
some of which have investment grade characteristics that help reduce the overall
leverage in the transaction.
The largest is Great Value Storage Portfolio, which represents 8.5% of the portfolio and is
considered by Kroll Bond Rating Agency to be AAA quality;
Moody's Investors Service views it as Aa1.
